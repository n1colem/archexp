## The goal of this project is to create a read me and a basic repository.
I will try out things here

_I'm not really sure how to do markdown properly yet_
But I will try
## The people in this project are:
* Nicole Meyer (me)
## Things I have learned:
* Some new things about Markdown (and a place to find info about it!: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax)
* That I should have a readme in each folder/repository

## Other cool things
* include options to contribute "How to contribute"
